                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul class="list_item">
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                        perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
